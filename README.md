This repository contains simple Python scripts demonstrating console input and output.

## Scripts

- `hello.py`: prints a greeting.
- `echo.py`: reads lines from standard input and prints them back out. The program stops when it encounters an empty line or end-of-file.

Run a script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 hello.py
python3 echo.py
```
