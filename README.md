# Trading

This repository stores sample datasets of EUR/USD prices and Python scripts for
testing different strategies.  The main strategy now operates on one minute
data while checking every 30 candles (30 minutes) for patterns.  Each trade
risks a fixed amount based on the starting equity so account growth remains
realistic during long simulations.

Package list:
Pandas, NumPy, MatLab and ReportLab
